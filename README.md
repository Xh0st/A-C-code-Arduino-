This code is designed to manage an air conditioning system for a **Ford Transit Custom**, controlling both the **compressor** and **fan** based on sensor readings and operational conditions.

### **Key Features**
- **Reads button state** to check if AC is requested.
- **Monitors pressure sensor** to ensure safe operation.
- **Controls the compressor** to cycle on and off safely.
- **Handles automatic shutdowns** based on runtime limits, safety conditions, and pressure thresholds.
- **Manages fan operation** to activate when needed.
- **Check oil pressure** to see if engine is running before starting the compressor.
- **Implements cooldown periods** before restarting the compressor.

This ensures the system runs efficiently while preventing **unsafe pressure levels** and unnecessary wear on components.
